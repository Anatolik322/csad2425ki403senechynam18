## rock paper scissors Project

## Project Overview

The documentation and source code needed to create a game of rock, paper, scissors are included in this repository. The major goal of this project is to enable users to play the game on a microcontroller-based platform by implementing the rock, paper, scissors game on an ESP-8266 microcontroller.

## Task Details

This project involves multiple stages:

-   Design and implement the logic of a rock, paper, scissors game.
-   Use ESP-8266 hardware for running the game.
-   Implement input/output handling using available hardware components.
-   Ensure that the game runs smoothly and handles basic user interaction.
-   Prepare for further development and integration with additional hardware in future tasks.
